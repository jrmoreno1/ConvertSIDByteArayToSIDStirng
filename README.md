# ConvertSIDByteArayToSIDStirng
Refactored version of code from CodeProject (https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/303160/Converting-a-SID-in-Array-of-bytes-to-String-versi) and github gist (https://gist.github.com/miromannino/04be6a64ea0b5f4d4254bb321e09d628)

The CodeProject solution was already in VB, the gist was in Java but was easily translated to C# and thence to VB.  Why VB?  Why not?
